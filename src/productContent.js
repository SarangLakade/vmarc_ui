In these conditions tinned copper should be used as it forms a protective film over it & prevents it from tarnishing. Aluminium oxide film present on the surface of aluminium conductor acts as a barrier to protect it from corrosion. CONDUCTOR CONSTRUCTION The most economical construction for conductor is solid conductor i.e. conductor made of one single wire. As the area of conductor increases, solid conductor becomes stiffer and difficult to handle, therefore stranded construction is adopted. Here the conductor is made of number of strands. The strands are arranged in spiral layers in 1+6+12+18+…… formations. This geometrical progression of strands provides more compactness & flexibility. The stranded construction of conductors is more suitable for crimping of lugs. To economize the weight of insulating material, to optimize overall diameter, conductors are shaped & compacted in higher sized cables. The stranded conductor is shaped in to a segment of a circle so that when all the cores are laid, they form a complete circle. These segments are identified as 2 Core- 180 degrees, 3 Core- 120 degrees, 4 Core- 90 degrees, 3.5 Core- 100/60 degrees.

            des: `Cable armouring consists of galvanized steel wire / strip provided over the inner sheath in multi core cables and aluminium round wire / strip over the insulation in single core cables. It provides mechanical protection to the cable & carries earth fault current in case of short circuit of a core with armour.
            <br/>As per IS:1554 (Part-1) 1988, round wire armouring is provided in cable, where calculated diameter under armour is upto 13 mm. Above this the armouring is either with round wire or strip of size 4mm x 0.80mm. In long run of cables and in case of mines, round wire armouring is a must, as strip construction provide higher resistance to earth fault current and sometimes this current may not be sufficient to operate the circuit breaker in case of earth fault. In mines, the resistance of the armour in no case should exceed the resistance of the main core by more than 33% for safety reasons. To achieve this, sometimes tinned hard drawn copper wires are used along with galvanized steel wires. Sometimes two layers of round steel wire or steel strip are provided in opposite direction with barrier tape in between to provide extra protection. In case of single core cable for use in AC circuits, the material for armouring has to be non magnetic, as in this case the return current is not passing through the same cable and hence it will not cancel the magnetic field produced by the current. These magnetic lines which are oscillating in case of AC current will give rise to eddy current in magnetic armouring and hence armouring will become hot and this may lead to the failure of the cable. Generally hard drawn aluminium wires / strip are used for armouring in this case.`,

  Currently in Power, Chemical, Fertilizer and Cement plants many PVC cables are placed in the cable shaft or on cable trays. In case of fire burning of this huge bunch of PVC cables, emits a dense corrosive smoke. Due to thick black smoke and toxic HCL content of the smoke visibility is impaired to a large extent & it also creates suffocation which totally defeats firefighting.
<br/>
  To overcome these deficiencies cables were developed with FR / FRLSH / LSZH properties. We are capable of providing cables with any of these properties.

              <li>XLPE is thermosetting in nature therefore it cannot be reprocessed.</li>
              <li>Higher insulation resistance.</li>
              <li>Higher resistance to moisture.</li>

              <li>Low Dielectric Losses.</li>
              <li>Better resistance to chemicals.</li>

                Lower installation charges as the diameter of cable is comparatively lesser
                with smaller bending radius, requiring less space requirement for laying of
                cables.

            <strong>“V-Marc”</strong> is one of the most renowned manufacturer of India
            having a wide range of PVC/XLPE Insulated 3 Core Flat Cables. Our
            manufacturing units are well equipped with modern plant and machinery and have
            complete testing equipment backed up with well qualified and trained
            personnel. “V-Marc” 3 Core Flat Cables are used for quality conscious
            electrical contractors and recommended by leading consultants, builders, EPC
            buyers and are extensively used for domestic, industrial &amp; agricultural
            purposes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>“V-Marc” </strong>3 core flat cables are highly recommended for
            submersible applications and manufactured with conductor comprised of annealed
            bare copper of electrolytic grade, bunched properly to ensure desired
            flexibility. We have Submersible cables insulated with a thermoset polymer
            known as cross linked polyethylene (XLPE) with uniform thickness. Each of the
            cores is coloured as red, yellow and blue by using modern extrusion
            techniques. The sheath with uniform thickness and moisture resistant PVC
            (Grade ST2) compound which is formulated and manufactured in-house is extruded
            over these coloured cores in a flat formation. The colour of the sheath is
            black / blue. The cable undergoes stringent quality checks from the inward of
            raw materials, during various stages of manufacturing and final testing as per
            the laid down specification and our own internal stringent quality norms. The
            cables are available with progressive sequential length marking, company name,
            size &amp; voltage imprinted or embossed on sheath.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Following are the advantages offered by XLPE insulated cables over the PVC
            insulated cables.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Higher Current Rating: It can withstand continuous conductor temperature of
              90°C as against 70°C for PVC. This means higher current carrying capacity
              and hence it is possible to use one size lower than that of PVC for the same
              current rating. These cables can withstand extreme voltage fluctuations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Higher Short Circuit Rating: It can withstand up to 130°C during emergency
              overloading as against 120°C for PVC. Hence, in case of emergency it can
              sustain for longer period of time as compared to PVC.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lighter in weight and smaller bending radius: It has lower density than PVC
              which makes them lighter in weight and has smaller bending radius than that
              of PVC.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lower di-electric constant and power factor: It results in saving in power
              losses which means saving in costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Better Impact, abrasion, corrosion resistant: XLPE cables are safer than PVC
              cables against mechanical damage, abrasion &amp; corrosion.
            </li>
